# zextra

This repository is for some extra nodejs scripts used on my websites and Thebotcat. Their code is placed here in case they may be useful to someone else. It is licensed primarily with the Unlicense but also with the MIT license in case the Unlicense is not legally applicable in your jurisdiction. The repository name begins with a z to make it appear at the bottom of my repositories folder.
